A smart, web-based platform that connects users with skilled service providers using an intelligent hybrid recommendation system. The goal is to make service discovery simpler, more personalized, and more inclusive for both users and independent service providers.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

This platform helps users find service providers such as plumbers, electricians, tutors, mechanics, and more based on their preferences and past interactions.
It also allows independent skilled individuals to register as providers and advertise their services.

To improve user experience, the system uses a **hybrid machine learning model** combining:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for similarity-based and content-based recommendations
* **Apriori** for discovering frequent service usage patterns

This combination helps generate accurate, personalized service suggestions.
