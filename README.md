## 🚀 **Overview**

This project enables users to find service providers such as plumbers, electricians, tutors, mechanics, etc., based on preferences, behavior, and contextual needs.
It also allows skilled individuals to register as service providers and showcase their services.

The platform integrates a **hybrid ML model** combining:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** → User similarity & content-based recommendations
* **Apriori Algorithm** → Frequent service pattern mining

Together, these power personalized service recommendations that improve user experience and engagement.
